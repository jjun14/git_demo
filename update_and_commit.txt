1. I first forked the GitHub repository that is found at: https://github.com/jjun14/git_demo.  This gave me my own copy of the repo that I could now clone.
2. git clone https://github.com/juliansunn/git_demo.git
    - This is the command to clone my own repo to a local repo that was previously forked.  Now I can make edits to my local repo
3. Edited the demo_index.html file within my local repository
4. git add demo_index.html 
    - added demo_index.html to be committed
5. git commit -m "made changes to demo_index.html"
    - commited the changes to demo_index.html that were in the staging area.
6. git push origin master
    - this command pushed all committed changes back to my repo located on GitHub.com.
7. On github.com, click on Pull requests and then select add Pull Request.  You are submitting your code to be merged with the main git_demo repository.
