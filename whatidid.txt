What I did:

1. I went to the link and then found the repository I wanted to fork.
2. I went to the fork button and pushed it.
3. Then I cloned the fork using the desktop Github.
4. Then I went to the location of the fork in command line.
5. I got into demo-index.html and used the esc i and esc :wp to make modifcations to the code in the file.
6. After saving, I staged, committed and pushed the change to the github version online.
7. Then I clicked the button to initialize a push request, and I wrote a nice rationale as to why the changes should be accepted. 
8. According to Github, it has been noted that I want to merge my changes with the master.
