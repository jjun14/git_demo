    Virbil is my GitHub name and has been my moniker since probably 2001.
    From the 1995 movie, Unusual Suspects, Kevin Spacey's character's name
    was "Verbal" Kent but I always thought it was Virbil. So there you have
    it.
    <!-- Your favorite coding language -->
    I think C#... but the barrier to entry for studying/learning this on my
    own was much higher than JavaScript or Python so using Coding Dojo to 
    help with Python deep dive to see if C# will make more sense... who
    knows - maybe I will like Python more.
